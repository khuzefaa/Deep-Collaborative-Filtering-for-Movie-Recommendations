# Deep-Collaborative-Filtering-for-Movie-Recommendations
This project implements a sophisticated Deep Collaborative Filtering system for movie recommendations using neural networks. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering approaches that rely on matrix factorization, this deep learning-based solution can capture complex non-linear relationships between users and movies.
üé¨ Problem Statement
Traditional recommendation systems face several challenges:

Linear Assumptions: Matrix factorization assumes linear relationships between user preferences
Cold Start Problem: Difficulty recommending to new users or new movies
Sparsity Issues: Most user-movie interaction matrices are highly sparse
Scalability Concerns: Performance degrades with massive datasets

This project addresses these challenges by leveraging deep neural networks to learn rich, non-linear representations of users and movies.
üß† Technical Approach
Architecture Overview
The model combines several advanced techniques:

Embedding Layers:

Convert user and movie IDs into dense vector representations
Learn latent features automatically from interaction data
Capture semantic relationships between entities


Deep Neural Network:

Multi-layer architecture with ReLU activations
Dropout and batch normalization for regularization
Learns complex interaction patterns between embeddings


Bias Terms:

Global bias for dataset-wide rating tendencies
User-specific bias for individual rating patterns
Movie-specific bias for movie quality effects


Hybrid Prediction:

Combines traditional matrix factorization with deep learning
Balances interpretability with modeling power



Mathematical Foundation
The model predicts ratings using the formula:
Rating = Global_Bias + User_Bias + Movie_Bias + DeepNetwork(User_Embedding ‚äï Movie_Embedding)
Where ‚äï represents concatenation and the deep network learns non-linear transformations.
üìä Dataset & Features
Synthetic Dataset Generation
The project includes a sophisticated data generator that creates realistic movie rating scenarios:

User Profiles: Age, favorite genres, rating patterns
Movie Metadata: Genres, release years, popularity scores
Realistic Interactions: Bias towards preferred genres, temporal patterns
Statistical Properties: Mimics real-world rating distributions

Scalability Design
The synthetic approach allows testing various scenarios:

Small datasets (1K users, 500 movies) for rapid prototyping
Large datasets (100K+ users, 10K+ movies) for production testing
Configurable sparsity levels and rating distributions
