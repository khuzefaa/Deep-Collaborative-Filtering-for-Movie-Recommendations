# Deep-Collaborative-Filtering-for-Movie-Recommendations
This project implements a sophisticated Deep Collaborative Filtering system for movie recommendations using neural networks. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering approaches that rely on matrix factorization, this deep learning-based solution can capture complex non-linear relationships between users and movies.
